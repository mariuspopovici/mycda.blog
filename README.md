# MyCdA.App Blog

This is the source repository the **Jekyll** based blog published at https://blog.mycda.app
The purpose of this repository is to host the MyCdA.App end user documentation, FAQs, announcements, posts on aerodynamics etc.

I started from a fork of [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) and added some additional features such as pagination, a customized dark theme, font awesome icons etc.

I'm using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) to build, process and deploy updates upon commit into the Github repo.
